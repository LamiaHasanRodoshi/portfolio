### Graduate Research Assistant  
**Cyber Guard Research Lab**  
Supervisor: [*Dr. Faysal Hossain Shezan* ](https://fhshezan.github.io/) 
📅 Oct 2023 – Present  

#### 🧪 Project 1: Automated PoC of Vulnerability Generation with LLMs
- Built an **agentic LLM-based system** to autonomously generate and validate **PoC exploits**.
- Supported **9 major frameworks**, including *TensorFlow, Tcpdump, zlib, Binutils,* and more.
- Integrated **RAG pipelines** with framework documentation, improving PoC success rate by **23%**.
- Used **Docker-based isolated environments** for automated exploit testing.
- Reduced **manual vulnerability analysis effort by 60%**.

#### 🛡️ Project 2: AI Agents Vetting System
- Investigating **backdoor attacks, data poisoning**, and other AI agent attack surfaces.
- Implementing **policy-based access control** and **privacy enforcement** using **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
- Analyzed **500+ open-source AI agents** for **EU AI Act & GDPR compliance**.
- Designed a vetting framework to help providers avoid penalties up to **€35M or 7% of annual turnover**.

#### ⚖️ Project 3: Detection of Copyrighted Code in LLM Training Corpus
- Developed an automated system using **AST-based code clone detection** and license analysis.
- Applied **NLP techniques** (Fill-Mask, Chain-of-Thought) and prompt engineering.
- Tested across **5 major LLMs** (GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, LLaMA, Qwen) in a black-box setting.
- Evaluated on **10,000+ copyrighted code samples** to support ethical AI training.
